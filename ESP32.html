    Introduction
  </h1>

  <p style="text-align:left;">
	<font face="seirf" size="5" color="#000000">
    We are doing this lab for many reasons all of which will help us get closer to understanding and building the drone. Using the bread board gives a basic idea of how they work and this will translate to building a curcit board on the drone. The programing may be an intro to the Arduino software but making the LED`s light up does more than just that. These LED`s will translate directly to the motors on the finale project and making them turn on and run while in flight. Although everything may seem totaly random and unrelated everything in the project will transfer over to the finale drone in one way or anothe.

    Materials
  </h2>
 
  <p style="text-align:left;">
	<font face="seirf" size="5" color="#000000"> 
The list of materials for this lab was not very long so keeping track of everything was not to hard. The materials consist of 8  diffrent LED`s, a simple resistor, a breadboard, and an Arduino.

   Description
  </h3>

  <p style="text-align:left;">
	<font face="seirf" size="5" color="#000000">
The way we did the coding for this project is easy enough to understand, each button when selected creates a diffrent outcome.

    Buttons
  </h3>

  <p style="text-align:left;">
	<font face="seirf" size="5" color="#000000">
Each button is programed to do thier own function, in this case they turn an LED on.
  <br>
 Up - up turns the first grenn LED on
  <br>
 Down - down turns the first yellow LED on
  <br>
 Left - left turns the first red LED on
  <br>
 Right - right turns the next yellow LED on
  <br>
 Forward - forward turns the next green LED on
  <br> 
 Backward - backward turns the last red LED on
  <br>
 Clockwise - clockwise turns the last yellow LED on
  <br>
 Counterclockwise - counterclockwise turns the last green LED on
